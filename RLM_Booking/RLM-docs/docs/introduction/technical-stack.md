# Technical Stack

This project leverages a variety of technologies to support robust backend processing, a responsive frontend, and scalable cloud infrastructure, all designed to help Red Light Ventures manage and optimize events through data-driven insights.

## Backend

- **Django (Python)**: Serves as the primary backend framework, handling server-side logic, API development, and integration with AWS services. Key responsibilities include:
  - **API Development**: Provides RESTful endpoints for frontend communication.
  - **User Authentication**: Manages secure access control for different user roles.
  - **Event Scheduling & Business Logic**: Contains core business functions, such as ticketing rules, scheduling algorithms, and pricing calculations.
  
## Frontend

- **React (JavaScript)**: Creates a dynamic and responsive UI for managing events. Key libraries and tools include:
  - **State Management**: Uses [insert any specific state management library, e.g., Redux or Context API] to manage complex states, such as ticket inventory and user preferences.
  - **Data Visualization**: [List any specific libraries here, e.g., D3.js or Chart.js, if applicable] for rendering insights like ticket sales trends.

## Cloud Infrastructure

- **AWS SageMaker**: Manages training, tuning, and deployment of machine learning models for tasks like ticket pricing predictions and attendance forecasting. Django connects to SageMaker models via [API Gateway / direct SDK integration], allowing secure interaction with deployed models.
- **AWS DynamoDB**: A NoSQL database to store high-volume data like event records, ticket inventories, and booking history. This choice enables fast, scalable access and is well-suited to Red Light Venturesâ€™ needs for low-latency operations.
- **AWS S3**: Stores static assets such as images, marketing media, and data backups. S3 also holds any exported analytics reports that may be shared with the client.
- **AWS EC2**: Hosts the Django backend, providing a reliable environment for production deployment. EC2 instances are configured for scalability and are monitored for performance.

## Additional Technologies

- **Python**: Used for backend development, data processing, and machine learning pipelines.
- **JavaScript, HTML, CSS**: Core frontend technologies with React, enabling a highly interactive and responsive user experience.

## Local Development Tools

- **Docker**: Used for containerization to streamline development and testing environments (if applicable).
- **Testing Libraries**: [List specific libraries, e.g., Jest, PyTest, etc.] to help ensure code quality and robustness.

This setup provides a clear pathway for data flow, security, and scalability, empowering Red Light Ventures with the tools to make data-driven decisions for event management.
