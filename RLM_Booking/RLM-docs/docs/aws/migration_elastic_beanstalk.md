# Migration and Elastic Beanstalk Planning

This document outlines my plan for a phased approach to adding a frontend using AWS Elastic Beanstalk to ensure a smooth migration and integration with existing backend components.

---

## A. Elastic Beanstalk Overview

### Purpose

- Elastic Beanstalk will host a future frontend app, integrating seamlessly with existing AWS services (e.g., DynamoDB, Lambda, SageMaker).

### Setup Steps

1. **API Gateway Integration**:

   - Use the existing API Gateway endpoints to connect the frontend with backend functionality.

2. **Web App Components**:

   - Deploy the frontend, such as a React app, on Elastic Beanstalk, and connect it to API Gateway for seamless interaction with backend services.

## B. Preparing for Migration

1. **Set Up REST APIs**:

   - Set up RESTful APIs with API Gateway and Lambda for core functions, allowing frontend access without reconfiguring backend.

2. **Organize Data and Resources with Tags**:

   - Use the tag resources by feature (e.g., `Feature: Modeling`, `Feature: Event Management`) for easier tracking and future migration planning.

## C. CI/CD Pipeline for Frontend Integration

1. **Add Frontend Deployment to CodePipeline**:

   - Extend CodePipeline to automate deployment for both backend and frontend services.

2. **Consistent Logging and Monitoring**:

   - Use CloudWatch to monitor performance and troubleshoot any frontend integration issues.
