# CI/CD and Deployment

This document covers the process we followed setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline application updates and maintain consistency.

---

## A. AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild

### Purpose

- Automates code deployment, ensuring consistent updates to AWS resources (e.g., Lambda functions, SageMaker models).

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a CodePipeline**:
   - Connect CodePipeline to the projectâ€™s Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
   - Define stages: Source (from Git), Build (CodeBuild), and Deploy (to relevant AWS services).
2. **CodeBuild Configuration**:
   - Set up a build environment with the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python for Lambda, PySpark for Glue jobs).
   - Use buildspec files to specify build commands and output artifacts.

---

## B. Automating Infrastructure Deployment

1. **AWS CloudFormation**:
   - Use CloudFormation templates to define and deploy infrastructure as code.
   - Store templates in the version control system for easy access and reuse.

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**:
   - Codify the infrastructure setup to ensure that future developers can replicate the environment.

## C. Testing and Deployment

1. **Test Lambda Functions and API Endpoints**:
   - Use the AWS Console to test functions directly and ensure the API Gateway endpoints function as expected.
2. **Deploy to Production**:
   - Use CodePipeline to push updates to Production after Development testing.
