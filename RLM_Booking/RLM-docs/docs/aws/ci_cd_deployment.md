# CI/CD and Deployment

This document covers our process to set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to streamline application updates and maintain consistency.

---

## A. AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild

### Purpose

- To automate code deployment and ensure consistent updates to AWS resources (e.g., Lambda functions, SageMaker models).

### Setup Steps

1. **Create a CodePipeline**:

    1. Connect CodePipeline to the projectâ€™s Git repository (e.g., GitHub).
    2. Define stages: Source (from Git), Build (CodeBuild), and Deploy (to relevant AWS services).

2. **CodeBuild Configuration**:

    1. Set up a build environment with the necessary dependencies (e.g., Python for Lambda, PySpark for Glue jobs).
    2. Use buildspec files to specify build commands and output artifacts.

## B. Automating Infrastructure Deployment

1. **AWS CloudFormation**:

    1. Use CloudFormation templates to define and deploy infrastructure as code.
    2. Store templates in the version control system for easy access and reuse.

2. **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)**:

    1. Codify the infrastructure setup to ensure that future developers can replicate the environment.
    2. (I'll finish later)

## C. Testing and Deployment

1. **Test Lambda Functions and API Endpoints**:

    - Use the AWS Console to test functions directly and ensure the API Gateway endpoints function as expected.

2. **Deploy to Production**:

    - Use CodePipeline to push updates to Production after Development testing.
